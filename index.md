- Farrokh Mistree	Systems Realization Laboratory @ OU, Norman, OK, USA		
- Jitesh Panchal	Design Engineering Laboratory @ Purdue, West Lafayette, IN, USA
- Guoxin Wang	Institute for Industrial Engineering @ Beijing Institute of Technology, China
- Yan Yan		Institute for Industrial Engineering @ Beijing Institute of Technology, China

In addition to the founding partners the ISRP includes:

- John Hall	Systems Realization Laboratory @ Buffalo, NY, USA
- Kemper Lewis	Design of Open Engineering Systems Laboratory @ Buffalo, NY, USA
- Jelena Milisavljevic-Syed	Systems Realization Laboratory @ Liverpool, Liverpool, UK 
- Zhenjun Ming	Systems Realization Laboratory @ OU, Norman, OK, USA
- Anand Balu Nellippallil 	CAVS, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA
- Raj Prabhu	CAVS, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA
- Dirk Schaefer	Systems Realization Laboratory @ Liverpool, Liverpool, UK

# Principles of Collaboration between Partners

In the ISRP the partners will focus on fundamental research that leads to scholarly publications, using information in the public domain, involving no proprietary information, or commercial or industrial application.  They will file no patent disclosures or file for patents of outcomes of this collaboration.  They will ensure that research collaboration is in compliance with the United States of Americaâ€™s Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2E003;  see Appendix G.  They will actively seek international and domestic project funding, share computational platforms, share data, and conduct collaborative research that results in scholarly publications.  The collaboration between the partners will include the following:

1. The partners will work to strengthen Sino-U.S.-UK student and faculty exchange, give short courses, and participate in mentoring each other.
2. The partners will carry out the joint study of international and domestic major projects, and cross-enterprise projects in fields of common interest.
3. The partners will initiate and convene international conferences or seminars associated with the realization of complex systems to promote technological exchange and communication among domestic and international peers.

Any partner can opt out of the ISRP by informing Guoxin Wang, Farrokh Mistree, and Dirk Schaefer in writing.
